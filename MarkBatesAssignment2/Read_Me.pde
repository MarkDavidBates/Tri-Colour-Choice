Brief: This programme creates a flag with the colours being
       chosen by the user. The RGB colour choice is stored in
       an array in the console and the final flag displayed.

Known bugs/problems: -Exiting/not inputting any data gives a 
                     null error and wont run the programme.
                     -Was unable to have the seperate sections 
                     change to their chosen colour. Currently,
                     the last three inputs determine the flag 
                     colour.
